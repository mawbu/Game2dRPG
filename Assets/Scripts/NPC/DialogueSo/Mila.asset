  dialogue:
  - 'Hello, Mabu

'
  - Hi,You must be the youngest brother named Mila, right?
  - That's right, I'm Mila, the manager of the "Eternal Snow Zone"
  - Because this place is cursed by the god "Winter", it is surrounded by snow and
    extremely low temperatures all year round.
  - The more I delved into the "Dungeon", the more interesting things I learned
  - I can see in your eyes a burning fire of determination to conquer the "Holy Grail"
  - You're so interesting
  - The lands you pass through are cursed by the gods, so it is very difficult for
    ordinary people to live here, and due to the magic power of the gods, there have
    been anomalies and monsters appearing.
  - I don't see the monsters here very differently in the other Dungeons, but I also
    get a lot of power when I hunt monsters
  - Now I need to kill as many monsters as possible so that the magic sword can absorb
    its power and evolve.
  - If you like to explore this "Eternal Snow Region", there are a lot of interesting
    things here, I think you will be much stronger. But remember to be careful the
    monsters here are very different from the areas you go through.
  - It's amazing, I get to meet new and stronger things again to be able to participate
    in the "Holy Grail Arena"
  - Good luck to you, now let's go, I'll wait here and help you if I can.
